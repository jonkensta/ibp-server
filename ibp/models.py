""":py:mod:`sqlalchemy` models used for the IBP database.

The following classes model the database abstraction used by IBP for its SQLite
database. These relate to the day-to-day IBP logistics, including:

    * recording results of searches for inmates through :py:class:`Inmate`,
    * recording volunteer lookups for inmates through :py:class:`Lookup`,
    * recording volunteer comments on inmates through :py:class:`Comment`,
    * processing book requests from inmates through :py:class:`Request`,
    * recording package shipments through :py:class:`Shipment`,
    * recording unit jurisdiction and address information through :py:class:`Unit`

In addition to the models, this module also defines a few convenience items:

    * Special column types :py:data:`Jurisdiction`, :py:class:`ReleaseDate`
    * Inmate foreign-key mix-in :py:class:`HasInmateIndexKey`

These utility items are exported and documented but should not likely be used
anywhere else apart from here.
